All files have been update for auto-indenting, deletion of trailing
whitespaces and DOS to Unix CR/LF to LF conversion.  Therefore there
may be cosmetically different, which are not listed here.

   faultModelData           : Moved to
                              ../SEGY-files/SummerFaultModelData

   fileReader/
      SegYFileReader.m      : Initialize number of samples if number of
              		      sample is <=0

   imageFaultModel.m        : Merged into imageModel.m

[NEW] imageModelData.m      : Merged from imageFaultModel.m and
   			      imageSaltToothModel.m

   imageSaltToothtModel.m   : Merged into imageModel.m

   plots/
      plotSeismicProgress.m : Because the parallel simulations can run
                              in any order, the "Current Shot" is not
			      neccessarily how many shot records have
			      been processed.  Added an iteration
			      counter on the title.

      LOGGER.m              : Fixed bug when logging on Linux rather
            		      than Windows (file name was losing the
			      first two characters on Linux when it
			      shouldn't have).  Added error messages.

   processShotRecords.m     : Pass in the name of the velocity model and
                              shot records, and then persist the data
                              between iterations rather than
                              unnecessarily re-reading the same data
                              files with each iteration.
