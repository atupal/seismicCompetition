%% Seismic Analysis by Reverse-Time Migration
% This document provides background information for the files of the
% *MATLAB Seismic Data Analysis Scientific Application*, part of the
% <http://sc14.supercomputing.org/engage/hpc-interconnections/sc14-student-cluster-competition
% SC'14 Student Cluster Competition>.

%% What is a Seismic Survey
% A seismic survey as it pertains to the analyses for this competition is
% the recording and then processing of reflected seismic waves from the
% Earth's subsurface for the purpose of imaging the subsurface structure.
% Watch the short YouTube video below for a more detailed description.

%% What is Seismic Migration
% From <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seismic_migration Wikipedia> _Seismic
% migration is the process by which seismic events are geometrically
% re-located in either space or time to the location the event occurred in
% the subsurface rather than the location that it was recorded at the
% surface, thereby creating a more accurate image of the subsurface._
%
% For this competition, we will focus on two dimensional models and perform
% depth migration using reverse-time migration.  Depth migration requires
% an initial velocity model of the subsurface structure that is used to
% process the seismic data (shot) records.

%% What is Reverse-Time Migration
% Reverse-time migration is a depth migration process where a velocity
% model of the subsurface is assumed, and this model is used to adjust the
% data by a four step process:
%
% # Solve the 2D wave-equation using the assumed velocity model in
% reverse-time.  This is done by feeding in the shot (data) record in
% reverse-time order as the boundary condition at the surface.
% # Solve the 2D wave-equation again with the velocity model in (forward)
% time.  Feed the solution from (1) in as the boundary condition.
% # Use the solutions of (1) and (2) across all time to resolve reflective
% boundaries as $\sum(ForwardTime_t*ReverseTime_t)$ to create the
% pre-stack migration image
% # Perform 1-3 repeatedly for each shot and add up all pre-stack images to
% get the final image of the subsurface
%
% An example animation from
% <https://www.geophysics.zmaw.de/index.php?id=271 Ekkehart Tessmer>
% is shown below, which also has a more detailed descriptions of the
% reverse-time migration process.

%
% Of course in reality, the velocity model is generally not known and has
% to be iteratively resolved.  So in practice, you'd guess a velocity
% model, perform reverse-time migration, update the velocity model based
% upon results, and repeat until the velocity model no longer changes.

%%  Your Goal
% For this competition, you will be provided with the correct velocity
% model and simulated shot records.  The imaging program will perform
% reverse-time migration on the simulated data set.  Your challenge will be
% to optimize the performance of this model by processing as many shot
% records as possible in a quick as time as possible.

%% Overview of the Code
% You have been provided several MATLAB files to perform the 2D
% Reverse-Time migration processing of simulated data.  There are two
% models included, a fault velocity model and a salt tooth velocity model.
%  The fault model is small and can run in a matter of minutes without
%  parallel computing.  The salt tooth model is of moderate size, and will
%  take hours to solve on a single compute node.
%
% The directory structure is as follows:
%
% * seismicCompetition - this folder contains files required
% * faultModelData - data files for the fault model
% * fileReader - utility functions for reading SEGY formatted
% data or managing reading/writing of data to disk for cases where the data
% is too large to fit into physical memory
% * html - this documentation
% * plots - utility functions for plotting overall progress
% * results - resulting stacked image and timings
% * rtm - functions for solving the 2D wave-equation in forward and reverse
% time, including GPU implementations
% * saltToothModelData - data files for the salt tooth model

%% Files of Interest to You
% The MATLAB files of interest for you are |imageFaultModel| and
% |imageSaltToothModel|.  These are the two programs you can run and
% benchmark performance with and without parallel computing and GPU.  To
% get a feel for how they work open up the |imageFaultModel| and take a
% look at the different code sections:
%
% * Run Configuration - defines files, path, and run mode
% * Model and Data Parameters - define the model parameters needed by other
% parts of the program.  These are the velocity and shot record geometric
% and time parameters.
% * Load Velocity Model - loads and plots the velocity model
% * Load Shot Data Records - defines the data source for shot record
% * Process Shots - Reverse Time Migration - performs the migration
% processing task using a defined run mode
%
% *TO BE REVIEWED BEFORE FINAL VERSION REPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASH START*
%
% *Note:  You need to modify the remoteVelocityFile/remoteShotFiles,
% runMode and readFromMem parameter in these files.  No other modifications
% should be required on your part.*
%
% remoteVelocityFile/remoteShotFiles - These files are read as memory
% mapped files.  If the workers (see Parallel Computing with MATLAB below)
% do not share a filesystem with the MATLAB client, the files will need to
% be read again by the workers.  Therefore, you'll need to list where the
% files are reachable on the compute nodes.  If the workers can reach the
% velocity and shot files, then the remoteVelocityFile and remoteShotFiles
% can each be set to the emptry string (i.e. '').
%
% readFromMem - The MATLAB code provided to you is set up to run in two
% modes:
%
% # Read from Memory (|readFromMem = true|)
% # Read from File (|readFromMem = false|)
%
% Set readFromMem to true if the remoteVelocityFile and remoteShotFiles are
% reachable from the compute nodes and do not need to be reread.
%
% If an entire parallel job is run on the machine running the MATLAB
% client, then set
%
%   readFromMem = true;
%
% Otherwise, if the parallel job is run across multiple nodes, then set
%
%   readFromMem = false;
%
% *TO BE REVIEWED BEFORE FINAL VERSION REPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASH END*
%
% runMode - The MATLAB code provided to you is set up to run in three
% modes (note: GPU is not currently implemented)
%
% # Single CPU (|runMode = {'serial'}|)
% # HPC Cluster (|runMode = {'parallel'}|)
% # HPC Cluster with GPUs (|runMode = {'parallel-gpu'}|)
%
% Set these to run 1 or more cases by defining |runMode| as shown above,
% or more than one together, such as
%
%   runMode = {'serial','parallel'};

%% Parallel Computing with MATLAB
% MATLAB supports parallel computing via the Parallel Computing Toolbox
% (PCT) and the MATLAB Distributed Computing Server (MDCS).  PCT allows you
% to perform parallel computations on multicore computers and GPUs.  MDCS
% allows you to extend computations to clusters and clouds.
%
% To run multicore jobs on the MATLAB host computer using PCT, a parpool
% ("parallel pool") must be open, allowing any parallel constructs (e.g.
% |parfor|, |parfeval|, and |spmd|) to marshal code to the MATLAB workers.
% By using MDCS, the parpool can be extended across multiple nodes.  By
% default, PCT provides a "local" profile to run multi-core jobs on the
% host computer.  In order to run multi-node jobs, a new profile will need
% to be created to submit jobs to a scheduler.  The scheduler can either be
% the MATLAB job scheduler (MJS) which ships with MDCS or a 3rd party
% scheduler (e.g. PBS, LSF, SLURM, etc.).  The MDCS documentation provides
% instructions on how to start the MJS as well as interfacing to 3rd party
% schedulers.
%
% NOTE: It is recommended to start no more than one worker per core.  The
% default size of a parpool is specified in the Preferences > Parallel
% Computing Toolbox > Parallel Pool.  To override the default size, call
% parpool with a specified pool size.
%
% NOTE: In parallel mode, if you receive the error message:
%
%   The client lost connection to worker 2. This might be due to network problems, or the interactive communicating job might have errored.
%
% there's a good chance each worker is consuming too much memory.  For
% instance, as it's currently shipped, the salt tooth model requires approx
% 7-8 GB RAM per worker.
%
% NOTE: In parallel mode, if you receive a warning or error message
% regarding the SeismicFileReader, the workers on the compute nodes cannot
% access the .segy file(s).  This would indicate that you need to set
% |readFromMem| to |false|.

%% Run It
% Run the first model, fault, to get a feel for how it works.  Type
%
%   imageFaultModel
%
% at the MATLAB command line.  You should see a plot of the velocity model,
% and after a minute or two, you should see four subplots.  The first is
% the velocity mode model, the second is the current state of the stacked
% image.  The third plot is the current shot (data) record displayed.  And
% the fourth plot is the reverse-time migrated image of the current shot.
% As the solution progresses, you will see it move over the domain.  The
% second plot is the recreation of the first plot and the image we care
% about.
%
% Now try running the salt model.  Type
%
%   imageSaltToothModel
%
% This will take considerable longer.  A new data set will be presented at
% the conference.

%% Timing
% While the image is being constructed, a timing file is being generated.
% The timing file consists primarily of the time steps for each shot
% record processed as well as the total time to solve the problem.  Scoring
% will be based on the number of shot records processed in the least
% amount of time.
